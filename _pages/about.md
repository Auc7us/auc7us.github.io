I am currently a Quantitative Researcher at [JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/cib/markets/global-equities) working towards devising pricing models for structured derivative payoffs. Prior to this, I was fortunate enough to work with [Prof. Ding Zhao](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/dingzhao/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/dingzhao/) on modelling autonomous vehicle trajectories as Markov Chains for my undergraduate thesis. During Summer '19 and '18, I interned at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) and [Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research](http://www.igcar.gov.in/) working on reinforcement learning and closed-loop control algorithms.

I like to focus on problems which closely impact our community, more specifically financial markets and robotics, and my work till now has been focused on understanding the nature of these problems. I am interested in solutions which build on machine learning, statistics, applied probability, optimization, and simulation. In the long term I plan to explore the interaction of economics, mathematics, physics and human biases in economic phenomena and describe them with rational and interpretable models. 

In addition to always looking to [learn](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) and [solve](/projects) problems, I like photography and working for the community. During my undergraduate years at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) I founded [Bumbling.Tumbling.Clicking.](https://www.bumblingtumblingclicking.in/) through which we worked towards promoting volunteering spirit and active citizenship among the youth.
